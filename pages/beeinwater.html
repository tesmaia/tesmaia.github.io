        <h3>Using ProceduralPath2D to build levels</h3>

        <p class="preline">
        While I've been sharing some progress on BlueSky, I've not updated this site, so it's time for a bit of catch-up. Here some progress on using procedural path.

        After building a prototype of a new plugin for smooth shapes to build levels with, I've been testing out a workflow to explore the level design for my metroidvania game. This level is a linear mechanics demonstration level where I can test out various new concepts.

        Smooth curves are easy, and the editor does not grind to a halt or glitch out after filling it with plenty of elements and making shapes span large distances. That said, I've decided to still cut levels into pieces and building each piece out of 1-3 procedural curves depending on the topology.

        Using the procedural system, I also managed to create a simple map system.

        I'm quite happy on how useful this is.

        Next up: it's time to share some actual gameplay design.

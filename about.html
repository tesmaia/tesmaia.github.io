                Hello, 
                
                I'm Tessa. I'm from the Netherlands and I am a full-stack software developer.

                My interests relate a lot towards social politics and how technology can be used to further human creativity. 
                I also like to solve problems, and I'm blessed that I can do that in my job and my hobbies:
                Gaming, gamedev and bouldering (that sport is rad :D).
                
                More information may follow later.
